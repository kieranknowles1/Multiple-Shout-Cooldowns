Allows you to queue up multiple shout cool downs at once

Inspired by Shout Cooldowns Parallelized, this mod allows you to have multiple
active shout cool downs with the shortest remaining cool down counting down at
any time. Intended to allow greater use of shouts in combat while keeping cool
downs meaningful.

The number of slots available is a combination of:
- A base value (default 1, the vanilla amount)
- The number of words known (disabled by default)
- The number of words unlocked (+1 slot per 15 unlocked default)


All values can be adjusted in the MCM. A notification will be displayed after
shouting or whenever a new slot is available.
